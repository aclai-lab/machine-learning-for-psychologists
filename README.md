# machine-learning-for-psychologists
This repository contains all the material for the machine learning course taught at the Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Católica de Murcia

During these sessions, you will learn how to write a complete machine learning pipeline for analysing the typical psychologists data leveraging the [Sole.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl) framework.

The material is provided in the form of `Jupyter notebooks` (files with `.ipynb` extension), which is the standard for writing, sharing, and reproducing scientific computing scripts.

## Setup

### Julia Programming Language 

If you are using Windows, you can install Julia by running the following in the command prompt:
```
winget install --name Julia --id 9NJNWW8PVKMN -e -s msstore
```
If you are using macOS or Linux, you can install Julia by running the following in your terminal:
```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```
This will install the latest stable version of Julia, as well as the `juliaup` tool. Start Julia from the command-line by typing `julia`.

For more information, please visit [Julia's official page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

Please note that the provided material was written using Julia 1.12. Hence, we suggest installing the 1.11 version explicitly as well:
```
juliaup add 1.12
```

### VS Code

To run the notebooks, we suggest installing VS Code using the installer provided from [its official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Once installed, open the `Extensions` view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), then enter the keyword `julia` and install the extension maintained by the `julialang` organization.

### JupyterLab (Alternative)

In case Visual Studio Code doesn't work for you, a good alternative is JupyterLab.

To install it, you can follow the instruction provided in [its official website](https://jupyter.org/install).

Once installed, you can open a JupyterLab session (e.g., tipying `jupyter-lab` in a linux terminal) to start a JupyterLab local server. This will also open a Web App in your browser, where you can run the notebooks. 

### Dependencies

This repository contains a `Project.toml` file, which is necessary to locally setup a self-contained Julia project and accommodate all the dependencies we are going to need.

To download the repository, click the `<> Code` button in the
[
    GitHub page of the course
](
    https://github.com/aclai-lab/machine-learning-for-psychologists
) and select `Download ZIP`.

Then, unzip it where you prefer on your system, open the `logic-and-machine-learning` folder in a terminal window and write `julia` to start a new Julia session.

First, we need to import the built-in package manager:
```julia
using Pkg
```
Then, we need to `activate` the project, i.e., we need to specify to Julia that we are working inside this folder:
```julia
Pkg.activate(".")
```
Finally, we use the method `instantiate` to install all the dependencies specified in the `Project.jl` file:
```julia
Pkg.instantiate()
```

### Troubleshooting

- *`Julia channel v1.12` not found when selecting a kernel in Visual Studio
Code.*

    Installing the `IJulia` package in the target channel seem to solve the problem:
    - start a new Julia session in a terminal (you can click `Ctrl+J` in Visual Studio Code) specifying the channel version we are interested in, in our case v1.11
    ```
    julia +1.11
    ```
    - press `]` to enter package management mode (notice the `Pkg>` instead of `julia` at the beginning of the line) type the following command:
    ```julia
    add IJulia
    ```
    - this should also build the `IJulia` package by default, creating an environment suitable for running a jupyter session with this specific version of Julia; if we want to be sure, we can also run the command explicitly:
    ```julia
    build IJulia
    ```
    - at this point, it could be necessary to run:
    ```julia
    IJulia.installkernel("Julia", "--project=@.")
    ```

    **Note**: This should not be needed on most machines; you may first want to try reinstalling `julia-lang` and `jupyter` extensions in Visual Studio Code and/or rebooting your machine.
